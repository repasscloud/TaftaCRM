### Models

1. Internal/System
  - This would include all the core models that relate directly to the CRM's system-level operations. These models are crucial for the system's basic functionality and are not exposed to the end user.
1. Client/Data
  - These models deal directly with the client's operational data. They are specific to client activities and are used to manage client-related information.
1. Client/Plugins
  - Consider this directory for holding models that are specific to optional features or plugins. For example, if your CRM can integrate with external services or if there are modular features that can be added or removed, models supporting these functionalities would go here.
1. Shared/Utilities
  - Utility models and helpers that provide functionality used across various parts of the application (both internal and client-specific). This helps avoid duplication and promotes a cleaner architecture.
1. Shared/Interfaces
  - Interfaces that define system-wide contracts ensure consistency and enforce certain structures across various parts of the application. Placing them in a shared directory makes it clear that they can be implemented in multiple contexts.
1. Shared/Enums
  - Common enums used throughout the system. Enumerations often represent fixed sets of values (like status codes, configuration options, etc.), and centralizing them helps maintain consistency.
